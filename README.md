# Module11Challenge
The task is to create:
1. A Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods.
2. Plot the results to visually show the performance to the board.

# Technologies
- python 3.8.15 (compatible with Prophet)
- JupyterLab
- libraries: pandas, hvplot, pathlib, prophet, numpy, holoviews, datetime
- MacOs
# Installation
If you want to run the program yourself and/or enter different data, do the following:
1. To install the project files, go to the GitHub page for the workshop, click on the green Code button, then download the repository as a ZIP file.

**Question:** Does any day-of-week effect that you observe concentrate in just a few hours of that day? </br>

**Answer:** That question's phrased very poorly. The weekends are less intense, so the hourly 'Search Trends' average is lower than on weekdays.
